Hi,  hxcpp aswing 2.0  is an unstable development version    now 

I myself, after working hours to the New Year



hxcpp aswing  it have some memory recovery bug,need some of the testing and characterization


if you can help me

Welcome!


 as ()  use cast()
Also
public static function removeAll (doc: DisplayObjectContainer): Void {}
For memory recovery DisplayObject


 

cellCom.addEventListener (MouseEvent.ROLL_OUT, __onItemRollOut);

private function __onItemRollOut (e: MouseEvent): Void {

e.currentTarget empty
}


Finally aswing architecture nme larger version changes
