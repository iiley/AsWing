How to use AsWing A3?

See Test folder sources.

Notice:

You'd better to call :

		stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;
		stage.stageFocusRect = false;
		AsWingManager.setRoot(this);

at the begin of your application code.
Make sure to disable actionscript warning for the compiler when compile AsWing A3 lib.
